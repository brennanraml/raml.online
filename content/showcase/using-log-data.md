# Using Log Data to Create Business Recommendations

For this project, we were tasked with aggregating and analyzing data from an SQL database containing Yelp reviews for businesses within Portland, OR in order to recommend the type of business our “clients” should open. My group organized reviews based on business and sentiment, which allowed us to identify trends and gaps in the market. From our analysis, we were able to recommend a business that matched their interests as well as provided them with ways to promote the launch and the best month to open their business.
